Sentinel lets you set a schedule for the websites that are hardest to resist — social media, gaming, streaming — and enforces it without giving you (or anyone else) an easy way out. It runs silently in the background as a system service. Turning it off requires your admin password.

It works across every browser and every app, not just the one you happen to have open. There's no extension to disable, no toggle to flick.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why not a browser extension?

Browser extensions are easy to bypass — one click to disable, and kids know it. Sentinel works at the operating system level: it rewrites the system hosts file (or runs a local DNS resolver in advanced mode), so blocked sites don't load anywhere on the machine, in any browser or app. Getting around it requires admin credentials.

### How does this compare to DNS blockers like AdGuard Home?

AdGuard Home is a solid network-wide DNS blocker, and Sentinel can run alongside it (see [Running alongside AdGuard Home](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#running-sentinel-alongside-adguard-home-or-any-other-local-dns-service)). But its scheduling model has hard limits that make fine-grained personal productivity rules impractical — all three are tracked as open feature requests on their repo:

| Capability | Sentinel | AdGuard Home |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple block windows per day per group | ✅ e.g. 9–12 and 2–6 | ❌ One slot per day ([#7253](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/7253)) |
| Independent schedule per domain group | ✅ Each rule is separate | ❌ One shared schedule for all ([#7146](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/7146)) |
| Custom domain groups | ✅ Any domains you choose | ❌ Predefined catalog only ([#1692](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1692)) |
| Browser tab auto-close on block | ✅ macOS | ❌ |
| Pre-block notifications | ✅ macOS | ❌ |

AdGuard Home excels at network-wide content filtering — blocking ad trackers or adult content for every device on a home network. Sentinel is built for personal schedule enforcement on a single machine: granular enough to say "block Reddit 9–12 and 2–6, block gaming all evening, and leave streaming open on weekends." If you already run AdGuard Home, see [Running alongside AdGuard Home](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#running-sentinel-alongside-adguard-home-or-any-other-local-dns-service) to run both together.

## What it does

- **Set a schedule, not a willpower battle** — group the sites you want to limit (e.g. `games`, `social`) and define exactly when they're off-limits. Blocks apply the moment the clock hits your window, and lift the moment it ends.
- **Per-group granularity, multiple windows per day** — each domain group has its own independent schedule. Stack multiple block/allow windows in the same day (e.g. block social media 9–12 and 2–6, block gaming from 8pm onward — all as separate rules).
- **Daily quotas (allowance mode)** — optionally cap how long a group is accessible each day. Add `"daily_quota_minutes": 30` to any rule and the group is blocked for the rest of the day once 30 minutes of active DNS usage is consumed — even if the scheduled window is still open. Requires `dns` or `strict` mode.
- **Tabs close automatically** — when a block begins, Chrome and Safari close any open tabs for blocked sites. No willpower required. (macOS)
- **A heads-up before the block** — a native notification appears 3 minutes early so you can finish what you're doing before the sites go dark. (macOS)
- **Live config — no restart needed** — edit the schedule file and save; changes take effect within 60 seconds.
- **Built-in web dashboard** — manage rules, check what's currently blocked, and test schedules before they go live, all at `http://localhost:8040`.
- **Survives sleep and wake** — closing the lid and reopening hours later works correctly; the scheduler catches up on the next minute tick.
- **Clean uninstall** — one command removes every system change the daemon made, leaving the machine exactly as it was.

## Install

### Option A — One-liner (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/vsangava/sentinel/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The script detects your Mac's architecture, downloads the right binary, removes the macOS quarantine flag, installs it to `/usr/local/bin/sentinel`, registers the service, and starts it.

Prefer to inspect before running?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/vsangava/sentinel/releases/latest/download/install.sh -o install.sh
less install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Option B — Manual (two commands)

**[→ Download from the latest release](https://github.com/vsangava/sentinel/releases/latest)**

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | `sentinel-macos-arm64` |
| macOS Intel | `sentinel-macos-amd64` |
| Windows x86_64 | `sentinel-windows-amd64.exe` |

```bash
chmod +x sentinel-macos-arm64          # or sentinel-macos-amd64 on Intel
sudo ./sentinel-macos-arm64 setup
```

`setup` copies the binary to `/usr/local/bin/sentinel`, registers the service with launchd, and starts it. You can delete the downloaded file afterwards.

### Verify

Open `http://localhost:8040` — the dashboard should load. It comes pre-loaded with sample rules for `games`, `videos`, and `social` groups. Edit the config to match your needs ([Configuration](#configuration)).

<details>
<summary>Advanced: DNS and strict modes</summary>

In `dns` or `strict` mode you also need to point your OS resolver at the local proxy:

```bash
networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1
# or:
networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 127.0.0.1
```

Most users should leave the default `hosts` mode and skip this step. See [Enforcement modes](#enforcement-modes) for the differences.
</details>

---

## The web dashboard

Open **`http://localhost:8040`** while the service is running.

**Status tab** shows what's blocked right now, the current enforcement mode, and a timeline of upcoming block and unblock events for the next 24 hours. A good way to sanity-check that your schedule is doing what you expect.

<!-- Screenshot: dashboard Status tab — coming soon -->

**Test tab** lets you ask "would this site be blocked at this time?" before committing to a schedule. You can test against the live rules or paste in a draft config without touching anything live.

**Manage tab** is where you edit rules, add domain groups, and adjust settings. It's PIN-protected to add a small hurdle against impulsive changes — the PIN is just the current time (`HHMM`). The server also enforces an auth token for every API write, so the PIN isn't your only protection.

<!-- Screenshot: dashboard Manage tab — coming soon -->

### About the PIN

The PIN is the **current local time in `HHMM` format**, in 24-hour or 12-hour form:

| Local time | Valid PINs |
|---|---|
| 2:35 PM | `1435` or `0235` |
| 9:05 AM | `0905` |
| 9:05 PM | `2105` or `0905` |
| 12:00 noon | `1200` |
| 12:00 midnight | `0000` or `1200` |

The PIN is a friction layer — a moment of pause before making changes — not a security boundary. The real protection is the auth token in `config.json`, which the web UI uses for every mutating API call.

---

## Configuration

The daemon reads its configuration from a single JSON file:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS (service) | `/Library/Application Support/Sentinel/config.json` |
| Windows (service) | `%PROGRAMDATA%\Sentinel\config.json` |
| Any (`--local`) | `./config.json` (working directory) |

The file is created with defaults on first launch. The scheduler reloads it every minute — live edits take effect on the next tick, no restart required.

### Example config

        "Sunday":    [{"start": "00:00", "end": "23:59"}]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The default config ships with three groups. `games` and `videos` are blocked during focus windows — mornings (9–12), afternoons (2–4), and an evening hour (6–7) on weekdays; mornings and the evening hour on weekends. `social` is blocked all day, every day. Adjust the time slots, add your own groups (`work`, `news`), or set `is_active: false` on a rule to suspend it without deleting it.

### Field reference

- **`settings.enforcement_mode`** — `"hosts"` (default), `"dns"`, or `"strict"`. See [Enforcement modes](#enforcement-modes).
- **`settings.primary_dns` / `backup_dns`** — upstream resolvers used in `dns`/`strict` mode. Ignored in `hosts` mode.
- **`settings.dns_failure_mode`** — `"open"` (default) or `"closed"`. Controls what happens if Sentinel stops unexpectedly while in `dns`/`strict` mode. `"open"`: the OS DNS is set to `127.0.0.1 <backup_dns_host>`, so if Sentinel crashes the machine falls through to `backup_dns` and stays online (blocking lapses until launchd restarts the service). `"closed"`: only `127.0.0.1` is set — DNS fails entirely while Sentinel is down, making a crash unbypassable. Requires `backup_dns` to be a non-loopback IP on port 53; if it isn't, `"open"` silently behaves like `"closed"` and logs a warning. Ignored in `hosts` mode.
- **`settings.auth_token`** — auto-generated on first launch. The web UI sends this in `X-Auth-Token` for every mutating API call.
- **`groups`** — named lists of domains that rules are bound to. In `hosts` mode, common prefixes (`www.`, `m.`, `mobile.`, `app.`) are blocked automatically. In `dns` mode, subdomain matching is suffix-based (`a.b.example.com` is blocked if `example.com` is in the group).
- **`rules[].group`** — must match a key in `groups`.
- **`rules[].is_active`** — set to `false` to suspend a rule without deleting it.
- **`rules[].daily_quota_minutes`** *(optional)* — cap how many minutes per calendar day the group is accessible. Once this limit is reached the group is blocked for the rest of the day, regardless of the scheduled window. `0` or omitted means no quota. **Requires `dns` or `strict` enforcement mode** — usage is tracked at the DNS proxy layer and is not available in `hosts` mode. **Browsers with DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) enabled bypass the proxy entirely**, so their queries are not counted. Disable "Use secure DNS" in Chrome / "DNS over HTTPS" in Firefox to ensure accurate tracking, or switch to `strict` mode and add DoH provider domains (`dns.google`, `cloudflare-dns.com`) to a blocked group to force fallback to the system resolver.
- **`rules[].schedules`** — keyed by weekday (`"Monday"` … `"Sunday"`). Each value is an array of `{start, end}` slots in `HH:MM` 24-hour format. Domains are blocked when the current time falls in `[start, end)`.
- **`pause`** *(optional)* — `{"until": "<RFC3339 timestamp>"}`. All blocking suspended until that time. Cleared automatically when the timestamp passes.

---

## Pause & resume

Sometimes you need a legitimate break from your own rules — a video call, a quick research rabbit hole, a link a colleague sent. Use the **Manage** tab in the dashboard to pause for up to 4 hours, or use the API:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8040/api/config | jq -r '.settings.auth_token')

# Pause for 30 minutes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8040/api/pause \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"minutes": 30}'

# Resume immediately
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8040/api/pause \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"
```

The pause window is written to `config.json` as `pause.until` and cleared automatically when the time passes — no stale pauses left behind.

---

## Enforcement modes

Three modes are available. **`strict` is recommended on macOS** — it combines DNS-proxy blocking with kernel-level firewall rules so no app can route around it.

### `strict` ⭐ recommended on macOS

Runs a local DNS proxy on `127.0.0.1:53` **and** installs a `pf` (Packet Filter) anchor that drops outbound packets to the resolved IPs at the kernel level. On every scheduler tick the enforcer re-resolves all blocked domains and rewrites the firewall table from scratch, so CDN IP rotation doesn't create gaps in coverage.

**Best for:** macOS users who want the strongest blocking. Works against apps that hard-code their own DNS resolver (some VPNs, browsers in DoH mode) because the firewall blocks the IPs directly, not just the names. **Note:** pf blocks connections but does not intercept DNS-over-HTTPS traffic, so daily quota tracking is still inaccurate if a browser's DoH is active — disable "Use secure DNS" in Chrome / "DNS over HTTPS" in Firefox for accurate usage data.

**macOS only.** If pf setup fails (e.g. missing root), the enforcer degrades to DNS-only and logs a warning.

**Requires:** pointing your OS DNS at `127.0.0.1` (see [Install](#install) advanced note).

### `dns`

Runs a local DNS proxy on `127.0.0.1:53`. Blocked domains return `0.0.0.0` (A) and `::` (AAAA); everything else forwards to `primary_dns` (failover to `backup_dns`).

**Best for:** users who need wildcard subdomain blocking — any `*.example.com` subdomain is blocked if `example.com` is in the group — but don't need firewall-layer enforcement.

**Requires:** pointing your OS DNS at `127.0.0.1` (see [Install](#install) advanced note). Apps that hard-code their own resolver bypass it. **Browsers with DoH active** (Chrome "Use secure DNS", Firefox "DNS over HTTPS") also bypass the proxy — both blocking and usage tracking are ineffective for those browsers unless DoH is disabled.

### `hosts` (default, cross-platform)

Edits `/etc/hosts` (macOS) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows). Blocked entries live between marker lines (`# sentinel:begin` / `# sentinel:end`) and are atomically rewritten — a crash mid-write cannot corrupt the file. Other entries are never touched.

**Best for:** Windows users, or macOS users who prefer the simplest setup with no port binding or DNS reconfiguration.

**Limitation:** no wildcards — only a static prefix list (`www.`, `m.`, `mobile.`, `app.`), so very deep CDN subdomains aren't covered.

### Switching modes

Edit `enforcement_mode` in `config.json` and restart the service, or use the shorthand:

```bash
sudo ./sentinel --set-mode strict   # writes "strict" to config and exits
sudo ./sentinel start               # restart to pick it up
```

---

## Uninstall & cleanup

The all-in-one `clean` command undoes every system change the daemon made: stops the service, removes hosts entries, removes the pf anchor, resets DNS on every interface pointing at `127.0.0.1`, flushes the resolver cache, unregisters the service, removes the config directory, and verifies port 53 is free.

```bash
sudo sentinel clean         # asks before deleting config
sudo sentinel clean --yes   # deletes config without asking
```

If you'd rather drive the steps yourself:

```bash
sudo ./sentinel stop        # restores DNS/hosts changes
sudo ./sentinel uninstall   # removes the service registration
sudo rm -rf "/Library/Application Support/Sentinel"
```

> ⚠️ In `dns`/`strict` mode, do not delete the binary while the service is running with system DNS pointed at `127.0.0.1`, or the machine will lose name resolution. `clean` handles this correctly; manual removal does not.

# For developers

## Building from source

Requires Go 1.21+ (the release pipeline uses 1.26.2).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsangava/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

make build         # current OS only
make build-all     # macOS arm64 + amd64 + Windows amd64
```

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Build for current OS into `./sentinel` |
| `make build-all` | Cross-compile macOS arm64, macOS amd64, and Windows amd64 |
| `make test` | `go test ./...` |
| `make release` | `test` + `build-all` + `verify-binaries` (pre-release sanity check) |
| `make clean` | Remove built binaries |
| `make dev-install` | Build and install the service locally (`build` + `setup`); requires sudo |
| `make dev-uninstall` | Uninstall and fully clean up the service; requires sudo |

## Running tests

```bash
go test ./...                       # everything
go test ./internal/scheduler -v     # rule evaluation
go test ./internal/proxy -v         # DNS response generation
go test ./internal/enforcer -v      # hosts/dns/strict enforcer logic
go test ./internal/web -v           # HTTP handlers
```

The whole suite runs without root, without binding port 53, and without modifying any system file. Core logic is implemented as pure functions (`scheduler.EvaluateRulesAtTime`, `proxy.GetDNSResponse`, `enforcer.GenerateHostsEntries`, `pf.GenerateAnchorContent`) so tests pass `time.Time`, `config.Config`, and domain lists in directly.

The DNS-response tests query real upstream resolvers (`8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`), so you'll need internet access for `./internal/proxy`.

What the test suite does **not** cover (validated by hand — requires root and a live macOS environment):

- Port 53 binding
- System DNS reconfiguration (`networksetup`)
- `pf` rule loading
- AppleScript tab-closing in Chrome/Safari
- Service registration in launchd / Windows Service Manager

## Test utilities

Three flags let you exercise the daemon without installing it as a service. (`--local` is a fourth — it runs the full daemon using `./config.json`.)

### `--test-query "<time>" <domain>`

```bash
./sentinel --test-query "2024-04-01 10:30" youtube.com
```

Prints whether the domain would be blocked at that moment, the matching rule(s), and whether a 3-minute warning would fire. Uses `./config.json`. Time format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (24-hour).

### `--test-web`

```bash
./sentinel --test-web
# open http://localhost:8040
```

Runs the full dashboard against `./config.json` without installing the service. The hosts-preview and pf-preview endpoints show exactly what *would* be written without needing root.

### `--test-applescript`

```bash
./sentinel --test-applescript
```

Generates the AppleScript used by the tab-closer and optionally executes it. macOS only. Test domains: `facebook.com` (close), `reddit.com` and `roblox.com` (warning — only fires if a tab is open).

Tagged commits matching `v*` trigger the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```bash
make release          # local sanity check: tests + build-all
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

The workflow builds for `darwin/arm64` and `windows/amd64`, runs `go test ./...` on each, and attaches the binaries to the release. macOS Intel (`darwin/amd64`) is built locally by `make build-all` but is not part of the release matrix — add a row to `.github/workflows/release.yml` if you need it on the release page.
